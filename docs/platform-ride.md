# Platform-ride architecture & absorption-risk register

*How orca-fleet builds on the Claude Code / Agent SDK / MCP substrate: ride the native primitives
for topology and isolation, keep the verification + ops-hardening layer as the differentiator.*

## The principle

The substrate is absorbing **claim C** (coordinator/worker topology) and the isolation slice of
**claim D** right now, and it ships **no completion oracle**. So the durable value is **claim B**
(a SHA-bound evidence manifest + an independent second-session verifier that re-derives from git,
with a mandatory negative control and a frozen denominator) plus the rest of **D** (merge-train
serialization, reviewed-SHA freshness, attention budget, liveness-resume, one-router-per-worker).

**Rule of thumb:** if Anthropic ships it as a primitive, ride it — never reimplement it. Spend the
budget on B + D, which the platform does not provide.

## Ride vs. keep

| orca-fleet concept | Native primitive to ride | Keep as the differentiator |
|---|---|---|
| Coordinator + workers | agent teams: **lead + teammates**, shared task list (deps + file-lock claim), plan-first | coordinator-**never-writes-code** discipline; single **merge conductor** |
| Isolated worker | subagents with **`isolation: worktree`** (enforced) | — (isolation is free now) |
| Build-blind reviewer | **read-only subagent** (`tools: Read, Grep, Glob`; built-in Explore/Plan deny writes) | reviewer-mode independence checks ([evidence manifest §2](../runtime/evidence-manifest.md#2-independent-verification-the-coordinator-or-a-fresh-verifier-worker)) |
| Serialization substrate | shared task list (dependency unblock + file-lock claim) | merge-train ordering + hot-file chains |
| Independent verifier | **headless Agent SDK / `claude -p`** run (teammates do *not* spawn in `-p`, so it is naturally a lone, separate session) or an **MCP Task** | the re-derivation *content*: `merge-base --is-ancestor`, clean-env test at the SHA, `reviewed_sha == head_sha`, **negative control**, **frozen denominator** |
| Completion gate | plugin **`Stop` + `TaskCompleted`** hooks (exit 2 → block completion + feedback) | what the gate *checks* (the manifest), not that a gate exists |
| Attention budget | **`TeammateIdle`** hook (exit 2 → keep a teammate working) | the reviewer/builder ratio policy |
| Evidence freshness | MCP **ETag / content-versioning** (roadmap, 6–12mo) | the ledger was never the moat; negative control + frozen denominator are |
| Per-worker credentials | MCP **agent-identity / delegation** (roadmap) | one-router-per-worker + sandbox profiles; attest the verifier as a distinct principal |

**Load-bearing move:** run the verifier as a *different session/process*, **never as a teammate** —
teammate/cross-session messages are in-band and self-certifying, which is exactly the trace-as-oracle
failure the evidence protocol rejects.

## Absorption-risk register (2026-08-28)

Status: **SHIPPED** (live) · **ANNOUNCED** (public roadmap) · **SPECULATED** (inference).

| # | Risk | Status / horizon | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Agent-teams **GA** absorbs coordinator + workers + shared task list → claim C fully commoditized | SPECULATED, GA <6–18mo | Ride it; move value to B + D |
| R2 | Native read-only subagents + `isolation: worktree` already commoditize build-blind + isolation | SHIPPED, now | Keep coordinator-never-writes + single conductor + rest of D |
| R3 | `Stop`/`TaskCompleted` hooks make quality gates a **generic** surface (anyone ships a Stop-hook gate) | SHIPPED, now | Differentiate on B's *content*; prove it with the negative-control demo (#73) |
| R4 | `allowManagedHooksOnly` + plugin-subagent hook limits lock plugin gates out of managed/enterprise | SHIPPED, now | Ship the gate ALSO as an MCP Task / CI gate / SDK subprocess (#77) |
| R5 | agentskills.io standardizes an outcome/verification `metadata` vocabulary | SPECULATED, not on roadmap | Own the runtime behavior, not the metadata; keep `proof:` free-form |
| R6 | Agent SDK / Managed-Agents **advisor** becomes a git-grounded completion gate | SPECULATED | Watch; independent-session + negative control remain the differentiator |
| R7 | MCP **ETag + Tasks** make SHA-bound evidence *ledgers* trivial | ANNOUNCED, 6–12mo | Ledger was never the moat; ride the primitive |

## Signals watch-list

Track these dated artifacts; a change here is a threat signal (see the threat brief for detail):

- **Ruflo (claude-flow)** — `ruvnet/ruflo` releases + ADR index: watch Witness Verification (ADR-103)
  moving from install-integrity toward a **per-task completion** manifest, and any **negative control**
  or **frozen-denominator** addition to the Truth Verification / PAIR navigator.
- **Octomind** — release notes: the "checklist-from-request" + "provenance bit" moving toward an
  independent, git-grounded, negative-controlled gate.
- **Factory.ai** — research/news: validator-workers or Droid Shield git-audit repurposed from
  *security* to *completion* verification.
- **Anthropic** — Claude Code changelog + Agent SDK: agent-teams GA; any first-class verification/eval
  step in the SDK or Managed-Agents advisor.
- **MCP** — roadmap/SEPs: Tasks (SEP-2663), ETag/versioning (SEP-2549), agent-identity WG.
