# Public beta announcement — DRAFT, not published

**Status: draft.** This text is not posted anywhere. It is published only when every box under
[Gates before publishing](#gates-before-publishing) is checked, and it says only what the tree
supports at the 0.7.0 cut (`fda5e4e`). The
[2026-09-28 release-readiness review](../reviews/2026-09-28-release-readiness-review.md#8-what-it-takes-to-release)
drew the line this draft follows: the version cut is release hygiene, the announcement is what
the P0 and P1 findings gate. A maintainer who posts this early is announcing claims the
evidence does not yet carry.

## Gates before publishing

Each row is a witnessed act, not a code change. The issue holds the evidence.

- [ ] The release being announced is tagged, its provenance commit is recorded, and its GitHub
      Release exists ([#511](https://github.com/ravidsrk/orca-fleet/issues/511); the ops.md tag
      and record blocks, then the "Publishing Releases" block for the historical tags). The
      candidate is `v0.7.0` on `fda5e4e`; the size row below can move it to a later tag, and
      then every version and SHA in this file changes with it before posting.
- [ ] The `dist` branch holds the 0.7.0 bundle (`publish-dist.yml` ran on the tag push) and the
      plugin install has been witnessed on a clean machine, transcript under
      `docs/completion/evidence/` per [the witness procedure](../completion/PLUGIN-INSTALL-WITNESS.md)
      ([#518](https://github.com/ravidsrk/orca-fleet/issues/518)).
- [ ] The receipt trees under `docs/runs/` and `docs/reports/` are shrunk or relocated out of
      the plugin copy (review P1-5, the third part of #518), and the tree of the announced
      tag is the shrunk one. The plugin path copies the marketplace's default-branch tip, and
      the `dist` branch and any tag-based install copy the tag, so both must carry the shrink:
      if it lands after `v0.7.0`, the announced release is the first tag cut after it, not
      0.7.0. The witness transcript's `du -sh`, re-run at that tag's commit, shows the reduced
      size. Disclosing the full size is not a substitute: the review requires the copy to
      shrink before a public beta, and this box stays unchecked until it has.
- [ ] One recorded `review-it` or `ship-it` run on an Ubuntu host driven by `orca-ide`, so the
      Linux sentence below can drop the word "untested" (review §8, item 6). Until then the
      sentence stays as written.
- [ ] An external monitor polls the Actions API for `main`'s latest `validate` conclusion
      (`docs/ops.md`, incident step 1), so a no-runner outage is seen by something outside
      Actions ([#520](https://github.com/ravidsrk/orca-fleet/issues/520)'s outer layer).
- [ ] The proof paragraph below still matches the README's generated proof-status sentence on
      the day of posting. If an external `ship-it` run has bound by then
      ([#515](https://github.com/ravidsrk/orca-fleet/issues/515)), say so; if not, the
      paragraph makes no such claim and needs no edit.

## The text

### Title

orca-fleet 0.7.0: outcome-named autonomous fleets for the Orca runtime, now in public beta

### Body

orca-fleet is a catalog of missions for the [Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca) runtime.
Each mission is named for an outcome, never for a technique: `ship-it` turns a spec into a
released, verified change; `clean-sweep` drains a backlog; `harden-it` closes a security loop;
`prove-it` closes a test gap. A mission dispatches workers into isolated git worktrees, holds
them to a definition of done that is an evidence protocol rather than a narration, and hands
you pull requests against an integration branch. Promotion to your default branch is always
your click.

**What "beta" means here.** Every mission carries a proof tier that a validator enforces and a
test binds to the README's catalog table. Today three missions, `clean-sweep`, `harden-it` and
`prove-it`, stand at `self-run`: each has a run report that re-hashes at the commit it names,
with the manifest and the integrity inventory inside the run's own directory. Every other
mission stands at `doctrine-only`: written, validated, exercised in the self-test campaign, and
not yet bound to a run a stranger can re-derive. No mission stands at `external-run`. The
[run archive](../runs/README.md) records every run that really happened and says, per run,
whether it binds. If you run a doctrine-only mission and file the bundle through the
[call for runs](../call-for-runs.md), the tier advances on your evidence.

**What it does to your machine.** Workers run your coding agent with its permission prompts
off, because a worker that blocks on a prompt kills the run. Orca's worktree is an isolated
checkout, not a security sandbox. Each worker opens pull requests on your repository; the fleet
never merges to your default branch. The completion gate is advisory inside a worker's own
session; the sound verification surface is off-worker, in CI or a process the worker cannot
influence. For a first run use a repository you can afford to lose, a VM, or the `offload-it`
recipe. The full boundary is stated in the README under
[Before you run a mission](../../README.md#before-you-run-a-mission).

**What you need.** The Orca app running with the orchestration experimental feature enabled, at
or above the catalog pin (`runtime/pins.json`, v1.4.215 at this cut); the `orca` CLI, which is
`orca-ide` on Linux; Orca's `orchestration` and `orca-cli` skills installed for your agent host;
`git` and `gh`; Python 3.11 or newer. Every recorded run so far happened on macOS. Linux is
supported by the code as of 0.7.0, which resolves the CLI name correctly there for the first
time, and untested by a recorded run.

**Install.** Symlink individual missions into your agent's skills directory (the verified path),
or install the whole catalog as a Claude Code plugin, which is the one path that wires the
completion gate by construction. Copy installers, including the `skills` CLI, must point at the
`dist` branch, never at the repository root. The [install page](../install.md) has every path
and says which ones carry the gate.

**Support window.** The catalog is re-witnessed against the installed Orca binary on every
re-pin; 0.7.0 was tested against v1.4.209 through v1.4.215. Orca ships almost daily, so a weekly
probe files an issue when the pin falls behind, and a quarterly re-pin runs regardless.

**What is not claimed.** No mission is external-run. The verifier hashes evidence and re-derives
bindings; it does not re-run your tests for you. Nothing here is affiliated with or endorsed by
Stably, the Orca maintainers, or the authors of the upstream skill packs whose techniques the
workers use; those are credited in the README and in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

**How to help.** Run a mission and file the bundle ([call for runs](../call-for-runs.md), then
the [submission guide](../run-submission-guide.md)). Report what breaks through the issue
templates. The [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies everywhere the project
talks.

**What comes next.** 1.0 is defined by an executable checklist, `scripts/release_check.py`,
which prints one verdict per gate and exits non-zero on a standing skip. The road from this
beta to that release is a tracked epic on the issue tracker.

### Closing line

Cut from `fda5e4e` (or the announced tag's cut, per the gate list); every frozen gate green in
CI at that commit. Release notes are the CHANGELOG section the tag carries.

## Where it goes, in order

1. The GitHub Release body for `v0.7.0` (already generated from the CHANGELOG by
   `release.yml`; this text is the human summary above it, added by editing the Release).
2. The repository README, one line under the title, linking the Release.
3. The listings the [distribution page](../distribution.md) tracks, each led by the proof
   framing, never by a catalog count.
4. Anywhere else the maintainer chooses, with the same text and no stronger claim.
