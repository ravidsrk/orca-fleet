# 📱 field-test-it — proven on hardware, not on hope

> **Autonomy:** L4 (Osmani L0-L5, parallel delegation) — parallel fix workers per device-observed defect, each re-verified on the target; device pairing and anything outside the paired device set are your one-way gates.
> **Activation load:** ~33,800 tokens — this SKILL.md plus every playbook and runtime doc its Composes/rides clause makes mandatory ([why it is measured](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#instruction-budget))
> **Proof:** doctrine-only — no recorded run yet; the protocol is mechanism, not yet field-proven.

> Point it at "works on my machine, breaks on my phone." Come back to each on-device defect
> reproduced with artifacts, fixed, and re-proven on the same device at the head SHA — with a
> revert negative control that proves the fix caused the green.

## Invoke it

```
> test on a real device: <the flow or defect>
```

**Needs** (the skill's `compatibility` field, verbatim): HARD dependency: Orca runtime + orchestration skill (Orca CLI) plus the Orca emulator skills (orca-emulator for iOS simulators, orca-emulator-android for Android) or a paired physical device. git + gh. The app's own build/run toolchain. A fix worker playbook pack (mattpocock, addyosmani, gstack) — one router per worker.

## What it does

`field-test-it` is the on-device verification fleet. A **coordinator** loads the version-matched
guides (`orca skills get orca-emulator` / `orca-emulator-android`) and pairs a session per them —
Android via adb (accessibility tree + logcat are the command surface; emulator or adb-visible
physical), iOS via the Simulator pane (the app's own xcodebuild/simctl builds and installs first;
physical iOS is not a command surface of either skill and parks) — records the session's **oracle
tier** (EMULATOR vs PHYSICAL — a hardware-only defect class can never be proven on an emulator),
and captures a **pre-change baseline** of the target flows. Each defect is reproduced on-device (recording / accessibility
tree / logs), fixed by an rw worker, and **re-verified on-device at the head SHA** — plus the
negative control: revert the fix and the on-device failure returns. The post-change baseline is
ledgered for the next run.

The unit of work is **one device-observed defect** (or one device QA pass over a flow). The
defining property: the oracle is the ledgered device session — typed by tier (PHYSICAL or EMULATOR),
never upgraded silently — so a green desktop run is never accepted as device evidence.

## When to reach for it

- "Works on desktop, breaks on mobile — verify on a real device and fix it."
- "Run the onboarding flow on an emulator and prove the fix there."
- "Mobile regression: reproduce, fix, re-verify on hardware."

**When NOT to reach for it:**

- Web performance budgets — [`speed-it`](speed-it.md) (measurement oracle).
- WCAG conformance on a rendered surface — [`access-it`](access-it.md).
- Test-coverage gaps — [`prove-it`](prove-it.md) (suite oracle).
- A per-diff verdict — [`review-it`](review-it.md).

## Terminal states

| State | Meaning | Who acts on it |
|---|---|---|
| `FIELD-PROVEN` | every on-device defect fixed + re-verified on-device at head SHA; revert NC holds; baseline re-ledgered | nobody |
| `FIELD-PROVEN-WITH-PARKED` | ≥1 defect needs a device/step the session lacks; parked with the exact device + step named | the named owner runs the parked device step |

`FIELD-PROVEN-WITH-PARKED` is a degraded terminal; a chain stops there per
[`mission-chaining`](../../runtime/mission-chaining.md). Advancing requires a one-way human gate
recorded in the ledger, even when the next link's allowlist declares this state tolerable.

## Human gates

Device pairing, permission grants, storefront/account surfaces, and anything outside the paired
device set are one-way or human items under
[`gate-classification`](../../runtime/gate-classification.md) — a stranger's device is never
touched. App installs are host-side work on the coordinator's machine; fix workers run `PROFILE=rw`
per [`sandbox-policy`](../../runtime/sandbox-policy.md). A defect that won't reproduce is parked
with the gap named, never silently closed — and a hardware-only defect class is never "verified" on
the emulator tier.

## Convergence proof

`field-test-it` is done when every device-observed defect carries: repro artifact + fix +
on-device re-verify GREEN at `head_sha` + revert-to-red negative control, ledgered with the
capability tier — or a PARK naming the exact device and step it waits on. The before/after
baselines are recorded; the verifier replays the recorded artifacts at the merged SHA (the
archived repro re-driven expecting GREEN, plus a spot-check of the revert-RED receipt) — it never
re-applies an already-landed fix — and, on a ≥10% sample per the mutation-unit floor, a fresh
worker reverts the fix on a throwaway branch and re-drives the on-device flow expecting RED
(landed BASE is never modified). A green desktop run is never accepted as device evidence; a
one-time repro is marked flaky and re-driven, not closed.

## A worked example

*A run, sketched — the shape of one, not a transcript.*

> test on a real device: the camera-upload flow crashes on Android 14

**Pair.** An Android emulator through `orca-emulator-android`; the oracle tier `EMULATOR` and its
preconditions (API 34 image, camera permission granted) are recorded in the ledger.

**Baseline.** The pre-change flows are driven on the emulator and ledgered.

**Reproduce.** A recording plus `logcat` show the crash on return from the camera intent — the
artifact is the repro, not a description of it.

**Fix → review → land.** An `rw` worker writes the failing instrumented test first, then the fix.

**Re-verify on-device.** At the head SHA the flow is GREEN; the revert control re-drives it with
the fix reverted and the crash returns.

**Snapshot.** The post-change baseline is ledgered. One reported defect — thermal throttling on a
physical device — is parked: a hardware-only class is never "verified" on the emulator tier. The
run ends `FIELD-PROVEN-WITH-PARKED`.

## Failure modes this mission is built to prevent

| Anti-pattern | Why it burns you |
|---|---|
| Accepting an emulator-tier pass for a hardware-only defect class — sensors, thermal, radios | The oracle tier is recorded per defect and never upgraded silently |
| Accepting a desktop or simulator pass as device proof, or pairing hardware for an emulator flow | The oracle is the target the mission declared, in either direction |
| Closing a defect from a fix that "should work" | Only the on-device re-verify at the head SHA counts |
| Skipping the revert control because re-pairing is tedious | It is the only proof the fix caused the green |
| Treating a one-time repro as a fix target | Mark it flaky and re-drive; one observation is not a defect |
| Installing builds on devices outside the paired set | That is the sandbox-policy danger lane — a stranger's device is never touched |
| Leaving the baseline unledgered | The next run starts from memory |
