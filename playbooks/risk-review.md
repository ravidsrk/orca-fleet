# Playbook — risk-review  (REVIEW: scope-gated specialist lenses)

Recipe: Addy specialist skills (security, performance, accessibility, data-migration) + gstack
scope-gating + adaptive suppression. NOT run on every diff — DISPATCHED when the change surface
triggers the lens.

## Two invocation modes

Diff-triggered (the default, below) — a lens runs when the change surface signals it. TREE-WIDE
(harden-it's audit waves): the fixed point is the whole codebase at the BASE head; scope-gating is
bypassed and every requested lens runs over the full surface.

## Dispatch rule (scope-gated, diff-triggered mode)

Compute the signals with `runtime/scripts/diff_scope.py --json`, never by eye: it fail-louds on a base
it cannot resolve, so "we could not look" can never read as "nothing to look at" (#284).
Run a lens only when the diff signals it (auth/query/route/dep change → security; render/query/bundle
→ perf; component/markup → a11y; schema/migration → data-migration; public route/contract/interface
change → api-contract; new abstraction/helper/module the diff did not strictly need → simplification).
A change that stores, logs, exports, or forwards personal data triggers privacy.
Adaptive gating: a lens with 0 findings across its last 10+ dispatches auto-gates off; security,
privacy, and data-migration are NEVER_GATE (their value is the miss they'd catch).

The tally is never coordinator memory — it lives in the target repo's DECISIONS log
(`docs/DECISIONS.md`, ledger-contract.md): committed state that survives a crashed run and is
shared across runs and coordinators. Every lens dispatch appends one DECISIONS line with id
`lens-tally:<lens>`, class `mechanical`, and the dispatch's finding count as its answer. The gate
check runs BEFORE dispatching a lens: read that lens's tally lines newest-first; 10+ consecutive
zeros → auto-gate off, appended as its own `lens-gate:<lens>` decision line; any nonzero count
resets the streak. Two coordinators reading the same log reach the same gate verdict.

## The lenses (each a fresh-context worker, its own protocol)

- **Security:** threat-model-first (STRIDE per trust boundary) → OWASP Top 10 + OWASP LLM Top 10 +
  supply-chain. Treat model output as untrusted (no eval/SQL/shell/innerHTML); block dep scripts
  before first run, never `audit fix --force`; SSRF allowlist with a TOCTOU caveat. Rate limiting on
  auth endpoints must hold across instances — an in-memory limiter in front of >1 instance is a
  finding. Any destructive-path operation (delete/cleanup/migration teardown) validates its TARGET
  before acting: allowlisted root after symlink resolution, a depth floor below it, and ownership
  evidence read first — a shape check is not authorization. These checks are the FILESYSTEM form;
  for other destructive targets the equivalents are: a DB migration teardown → named environment
  allowlist + object identity re-read at execution + ownership proof; a cloud resource →
  account/project allowlist + resource identity (ARN/id) verified live. Two caveats, because the
  check reads stronger than it is: a marker written INSIDE the tree is self-attestation (anything
  that can write there can write the marker), so the expected owner must come from authenticated
  state and the marker needs integrity protection; and resolving a path then acting on the NAME is
  a check/use race wherever another process can swap an ancestor — hold the target by descriptor,
  or prove the hierarchy cannot change. A finding needs a
  concrete step-by-step exploit scenario; never test live APIs. One verified finding → grep the whole
  tree for VARIANTS. (Full audit→re-attack loop is `harden-it`; this is the bounded review lens.)
- **Performance:** measure-first (no optimizing without a baseline); symptom→cause tree (slow load →
  bundle vs TTFB); CWV targets; every fix carries a before→after to its metric contract; add a CI
  regression budget (GUARD). Backend red flags: N+1 fetch patterns; an index added with no query
  plan before and after; a cache key omitting an input the response depends on (tenant, locale,
  viewer); a cache with no staleness window or invalidation; a pool size raised in answer to
  exhaustion without finding what holds connections; a list endpoint with no pagination. Reviewing
  SOURCE only (no baseline reachable) → every finding is labelled **potential impact**, never a
  measured regression, and carries the measurement that would confirm it. Keep-or-revert
  discipline: a NEUTRAL result is a revert, not a keep —
  and every attempt, reverted or not, is ledgered so a dead idea is never re-tried next quarter.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA (keyboard, ARIA, focus, 4.5:1 contrast, target-size, focus-appearance, empty/error/loading states); a 2.2-only success criterion this per-diff lens cannot judge is recorded as a PARKED finding routed to `access-it` — the verdict names it, never a silent GO
  + the anti-AI-aesthetic check (no purple/gradient/rounded-2xl slop, no lorem hero).
- **Data-migration:** expand→migrate→contract (additive first, destructive last-and-alone); every
  migration has a TESTED down path written and run before merge; a schema change and its dependent
  code never ship in one deploy (Hyrum's Law + the Churn Rule).
- **API-contract:** public routes/interfaces changed → breaking-change check (removed/renamed
  fields, tightened validation, changed defaults, error-shape drift); versioning/deprecation path
  named for every break; consumer-compatibility evidence quoted, not assumed. Idempotency, where a
  retry can repeat an effect: the key is derived from the INTENT (client- or event-generated, stable
  across retries, distinct across intents), the claim is ATOMIC (a unique constraint picks the
  winner — check-then-act is a race), the payload is hashed and a reused key with a different body
  fails loudly, the in-flight-duplicate policy is stated (reject / bounded wait / pending+status),
  and retention outlives the LONGEST redelivery chain (dead-letter replays, dispute windows) —
  a key TTL shorter than the queue that can replay it is a duplicate waiting to happen.
- **Privacy** (NEVER_GATE, paired with security): security asks "can an attacker read it"; privacy
  asks "should we hold it at all, and for how long". Every personal-data field added or moved is
  CLASSIFIED (non-personal / personal / sensitive), collected against a STATED PURPOSE ("might be
  useful later" is latent breach scope, not a purpose), given a retention limit with a working
  deletion path that covers the copies (backups, caches, search indexes, analytics), and — for any
  third-party or model-vendor forwarding — gated on auditable consent. PII in telemetry or logs is
  a finding. A privacy finding whose fix exceeds this diff routes out as a mission-level item, not
  a silent nit.
- **Simplification** (advisory): hunts structure the diff did not need — new abstraction over one
  caller, helper used once, speculative generality, wrapper that adds no behavior. Findings are
  advisory-severity by default; "delete the unrequested structure" is the fix shape.

## Completion

Every triggered lens ran (or is a recorded gate-off); each finding names its lens, severity, and (for
security) an exploit scenario; findings emit in the shared schema for the mission's ledger.
