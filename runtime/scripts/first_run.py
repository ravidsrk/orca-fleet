"""first_run.py — a reproducible first run of the POSIX route, inert or live (#596).

One review unit is driven through the PUBLIC wrappers an operator types, never the provider
classes underneath them:

  preflight  preflight.py --mission review-it --runtime posix --mode readonly
  create     task_ops.py create --spec <frozen spec>
  dispatch   spawn_worker.sh <task> new-child <title> <agent>   (OPEN_FLEET_RUNTIME=posix, setsid)
  guard      deny-hook.sh --verify-settings on the registration the provider installed
  delivery   the launch the provider recorded carries the spec nonce, and the worker echoes it
  result     worker_ops.py show/read + check_reply.py: the worker's exit and its report
  verify     verify.py --unit-class report-only on a SHA-bound manifest, run in a checkout the
             coordinator cuts from git at the evidence head (never the worker's own tree)
  release    worker_ops.py retain, then release; the evidence commit survives both

and the run ends in a SHA-bound verdict line, `FIRST_RUN=GO` or `FIRST_RUN=NO-GO step=<s>`.

ONE code path, two kinds of worker:

  --worker inert (default)  an inert stand-in answers to the harness name from a private bin
      directory first on PATH, behind tripwires for every other harness name. It reads the
      spec and the change file it names, and answers in the harness's own result shape. No model
      is called and nothing is spent. A GO here is a FIXTURE result: it proves the fleet's
      route, never the harness.
  --worker live             only inside the container-based live harness (PR #668;
      scripts/live_container.py): anywhere else refused, before anything is read or created
      (containment.py). The operator's real harness on PATH does the review, and the receipt is labelled
      `live-unreviewed`: it becomes certification evidence only once a maintainer binds it into
      docs/runs/ (runtime/providers/certification.json says which cells hold).

Profiles: `ro` (default; the review-it shape — the worker prints its report and has no tool to
send mail. posix relays the completion line its assignment names as its `worker_done` and records a
clean exit without that line as `worker_died (exit=0)`; either settles the unit, and the
coordinator commits the report it read from the transcript, #596) and `rw` (the worker commits the
report itself, sends `worker_done`, then prints the same report as its final answer; both copies must
meet the contract, and its HEAD is re-read from git, never taken from the claim). The inert stand-in
is LITERAL: it prints its report only when the assignment asks, as a live worker does (#596).

The reviewed target is a two-commit repository the run synthesizes, or `--target <repo>`
(cloned into the sandbox, never modified) with `--base/--head`. Every artifact lives in one
sandbox directory: the state store, the clone, the worker worktree, the verifier checkout and
`receipt.json` (per-step argv, exit, elapsed seconds, failure and recovery hint). The sandbox
is removed after a GO unless `--keep`; it is always kept after a NO-GO.

`probes` runs the negative probes instead: unsupported profile, privilege escalation, unarmed
deny hook, malformed runtime response and missing capability, each through the same wrapper,
each required to refuse BEFORE a launch (the stand-in never runs, no dispatch is recorded).

Usage:
  first_run.py [run] [--profile ro|rw] [--agent <harness>] [--worker inert|live]
               [--target <repo> [--base <rev>] [--head <rev>]] [--workdir <dir>] [--keep]
               [--timeout <s>] [--json]
  first_run.py probes [--workdir <dir>] [--keep] [--json]

Exit: 0 GO · 1 NO-GO (receipt names the step) · 2 usage · 143/129 SIGTERM/SIGHUP (workers stopped).
