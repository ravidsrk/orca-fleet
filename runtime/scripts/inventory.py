"""Regenerate and re-check the integrity inventory embedded in a report.

A run report closes with an inventory of the artifacts it produced and their
sha256. Written by hand it is a claim; re-derived it is a check. This script is
both halves: ``write`` regenerates the block from the files on disk, ``check``
re-hashes every listed path and reports the drift.

Two block shapes are recognised, because both are already in use. Under a
heading matching ``## ... integrity inventory (sha256)`` (any depth, any leading
words, case-insensitive):

* a fenced block of ``<sha256>  <path>`` lines -- the ``sha256sum`` format; and
* a markdown table of ``| `path` | `hash` |`` rows, with a ``| --- |``
  separator row skipped.

Paths resolve against the repo root first, then against the report's own
directory -- a run report lists repo-relative paths, a per-directory README
lists its own siblings, and both are correct.

An inventory that names a path which no longer exists is NOT a mismatch. A
report is a dated snapshot: it may pin artifacts from a slice tip that has since
moved, or files that were deliberately retired. Those are reported as MISSING
and do not fail ``check``; a path that exists and hashes differently does.

Exit codes
    0  every path that exists matches its recorded hash
    1  at least one existing path hashes differently (``check``), or a path to
       be written does not exist (``write``)
    2  could not run -- no inventory block found, an unreadable report, or
       (``check``) not one listed path exists, so nothing was actually verified.
       A verification that examined nothing must not report success.

How to wire
    ``write`` runs at run close, after the last artifact is final: the block it
    emits is the thing a reader can re-derive. ``check`` runs in the same gate
    that reads the report -- the inventory is what makes a manifest's SHA pins
    meaningful, since a pin nobody re-computes is a comment. Exit 2 is the one
    that matters most: an inventory whose paths have all moved verified nothing,
    and must park rather than pass. Re-derive a historical report's hashes at
    the commit it names, not at HEAD.

    Example: ``inventory.py check docs/runs/2026-08-28-ship-it-self-run.md``

Signing (#386). An inventory a worker can write is a claim a worker can type.
``sign --key <seed>`` signs the document's ENTRY SET — every block's
``(path, sha256)`` pairs, sorted, re-derived from disk first — with the
coordinator's Ed25519 key (dispatch-sign.py's gen-key files, the same envelope
``{record, sig_b64}`` the dispatch record and the verifier transcript use). The
envelope is one detached line inside the inventory block, an HTML comment the
parser ignores and a renderer hides::

    <!-- inventory-signature {"record": {"entries": 2, "inventory_sha256": "…"}, "sig_b64": "…"} -->

``check --pubkey <path>`` then requires it: a missing envelope is refused, a
tampered entry (or signature) fails, another key fails. Without ``--pubkey``
``check`` reads the block exactly as before and never looks at the envelope —
what switches enforcement on for a run report is the committed
``.orca/dispatch-pubkey``, which run_report.py reads where the transcript rule
reads it. Stdlib only, offline: nothing here reaches a network.
