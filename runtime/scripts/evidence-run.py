"""evidence-run.py — the content-bound evidence ledger's RUNNER.

"Tests pass at that exact SHA in a clean env" was doctrine: a sentence in evidence-manifest.md §2
addressed to the coordinator, with no field any verifier read (docs/reviews/2026-09-10-review.md §4, U1 — UNTESTABLE).
This wrapper makes it a record, and `verify.py check_commands` makes that record a gate.

    evidence-run.py --label tests --manifest docs/reports/<unit>/manifest.json -- pytest -q
    evidence-run.py --label tests --manifest m.json --artifact docs/reports/u/test.txt -- make test

It is a TRANSPARENT wrapper, and that is load-bearing: the child's stdout/stderr pass through and
the child's exit code is ALWAYS this process's exit code. EVERY bookkeeping failure — an unwritable
manifest, a missing fingerprint, a non-git directory — is a stderr warning and nothing more. A
wrapper that can turn green tests red would be routed around within a week, and then the ledger
records nothing at all.

One record is appended to the manifest's `commands[]`:

    {"label", "ts", "cmd", "cmd_sha256", "exit", "duration_s", "commit", "wtree", "artifact"}

  - `cmd` is the exact command line (shlex.join of argv) and `cmd_sha256` its sha256, with no
    normalization — so a check can demand THIS command and not a similar one;
  - `commit` is HEAD at the time of the run (may be null in a repo with no commits);
  - `wtree` is `wtree.sh`'s working-tree content fingerprint — the freshness key. verify.py
    requires an exit-0 record whose `wtree` equals `git rev-parse <head_sha>^{tree}`, i.e. the run
    happened on exactly the content the head commit carries. A record made on other content is
    STALE and does not certify the head.

The manifest is created (`{"commands": []}`) if absent, so a unit can start recording before it has
anything else to say. A zero-length manifest, absent or pre-existing-empty, reads as a new ledger.
Ported in shape from gstack `bin/gstack-evidence` (MIT); see
docs/research/2026-09-10-upstream-audit/gstack.md §4.1. Unlike upstream's advisory `check`, the
downstream gate is FAIL-CLOSED.

Exit: the child's exit code · 1 only when there is no child to run (usage / exec failure).

    The read-modify-write runs under an flock on the manifest itself (#382): two parallel
    wrapped runs used to lose one record silently, and the wrapper's transparency meant no
    failure was even warned about. The lock covers read-through-write, so the loser waits.
    Not a sibling lockfile (#388): that outlives the run as untracked content, failing
    clean-tree gates and moving the next run's fingerprint off the committed tree. The
    rewrite is in place, so every waiter locks the same inode the holder wrote.

    Lock order, the only one: the pre-existing sidecar first (`sidecar_lock`, #393), then the
    manifest inode. Every writer that takes both takes them in this order, so no two can each
    hold one while waiting on the other.

    The sidecar join is check-then-act (#387 thread 4012510839). With none on disk this append
    goes on under the manifest lock alone, and a legacy writer can create and lock one after
    the check; its read-modify-write would then overlap this one under the other lock. So an
    append that joined no sidecar looks again immediately before it truncates. If one has
    appeared, it abandons the attempt (closing the manifest releases its lock), joins the
    sidecar, which blocks until the legacy rewrite is on disk, and starts over from the read.
    The rejoin cannot deadlock: the manifest lock is released BEFORE the sidecar is awaited, so
    the order above still holds. A legacy holder never takes the manifest lock, so it waits on
    nothing this append holds. A new writer that joined the sidecar waits on the manifest lock,
    which this one has already released.

    Residual window: a legacy writer that creates the sidecar, locks it and reads the manifest
    between the last look and the end of this write can still silently drop one of the two
    records. If the legacy rewrite lands after this one, this record is dropped; if its whole
    cycle fits before this truncate, the legacy record is. That gap is a seek, a truncate and
    one write, with no lock wait, read or parse inside it. Closing it would mean creating the
    sidecar here, which #388 forbids. Looking right after the manifest lock instead would leave
    the read and the parse inside the gap. A sidecar that appears at any earlier point is still
    there at the last look, since a legacy writer never removes its sidecar.
