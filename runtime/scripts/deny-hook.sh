# deny-hook.sh — PreToolUse guard for read-write workers (Bash, Edit, Write).
#
# The Never list and the worktree boundary are doctrine (runtime/sandbox-policy.md,
# playbooks/risk-review.md). Doctrine sits above the model; this sits below it.
# A read-write worker runs with the host's permission prompts turned down, so the
# only thing between an improvised `rm -rf ~` and the disk is a hook.
#
# Reads the PreToolUse event JSON on stdin and writes ONE decision object on
# stdout in the shape the host honors:
#
#   {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#     "permissionDecision":"deny|ask","permissionDecisionReason":"…"}}
#
# The nesting is load-bearing: a top-level permissionDecision is ignored, which
# is how a deny silently becomes an allow. Every field is JSON-encoded by
# python3 — never printf-interpolated, since a path carrying a quote produces
# malformed JSON and a malformed decision is no decision at all.
#
# POLARITY IS FAIL-CLOSED. Unparseable stdin, absent stdin, or no JSON parser on
# PATH all DENY. A boundary that fails open is not a boundary. Allow is the only
# decision this hook makes silently (exit 0, no output).
#
# HIGH tier (deny, never ask) for Bash. Every segment of a compound command is
# judged on its own, with env/VAR= prefixes stripped first, so a refused shape
# is refused wherever it sits rather than only in first position (#297). Still
# string matching: a segment whose target comes from a variable or a subshell is
# beyond it, and the Never list is the net for those. The refused shapes:
#   1. recursive delete whose every target is /, ~, $HOME or /*, or any
#      recursive delete carrying --no-preserve-root
#   2. force-push to the default branch, including the +main refspec form that
#      needs no flag at all — and deleting it outright, which carries no flag
#      either: `:main`, `git push -d`, `git push --delete` (#297)
#   3. `git push --force` / `-f` without --force-with-lease, on any target: the
#      lease is what makes a force-push recoverable, and a worker that has not
#      earned the lease has not earned the push
#   4. `orca orchestration reset` — one command that discards a whole fleet's
#      dispatch state
# Git global options between `git` and the subcommand (-C, -c, --git-dir and
# kin) are stripped before any of this is judged — `git -C /x push --force` is
# the push it names (#297). A deletion that spares the default branch asks
# rather than denies: re-pushing the ref recovers it, and recovery is a human
# call — except under a redirected repository (-C, --git-dir, GIT_DIR=), where
# the default is resolved in the hook's own cwd and the ref cannot be shown
# recoverable, so any remote-ref deletion denies (#321 review).
# --force-with-lease is deliberately NOT matched as a force-push — but a
# lease does not pardon a deletion, which is judged first.
#
# Never list (ask, per runtime/sandbox-policy.md): live-prod mutation, credential
# provisioning, destructive database or infrastructure teardown, unpinned remote
# code execution, publishing, and history-discarding local git. These are "ask"
# rather than "deny" because each has a legitimate form the human can authorize
# in the moment; the HIGH tier has none.
#
# Worktree boundary: when ORCA_UNIT_WORKTREE is set, a write outside it is DENIED.
# It covers the Edit/Write/MultiEdit file_path and NotebookEdit's notebook_path
# — the one write tool that spells the field differently (#297) — and, since a
# worker that can run a shell can spell the same write as `echo pwned >
# /etc/cron.d/x`, a Bash redirect or `tee` destination naming an ABSOLUTE path. Both go
# through one resolver, which follows the whole symlink chain, so an in-boundary
# name pointing out is judged by where it ends up however many links that takes.
#
# What the Bash half does NOT cover, and says so at the block itself: a relative
# target (the hook is not told the worker's cwd, and the segment before it may
# have been a `cd`, so judging one would be guessing), a `cp`/`mv`/`dd of=`
# destination, a path built from a variable, and an interpreter writing through
# its own API. The disposable sandbox is the boundary for those. The process's
# own standard streams and /dev/null are allowed by name — not by a /dev/ prefix,
# which would waive `> /dev/sda` along with them.
#
# A payload that parses but names no file_path (a non-file tool) is allowed. When
# the variable is unset the boundary is not enforced — an unset boundary is a
# configuration choice, and this hook says so rather than guessing one.
#
# Exit codes: always 0. The DECISION is the output, not the status — a non-zero
# exit from a hook is a hook error, which the host treats differently from a deny.
#
# How to wire — and what does NOT wire it. Nothing in this repository registers
# this hook, and this header used to say the dispatcher did (PR #277 review, P2).
# It cannot, on either lane spawn_worker.sh has: the supervised `worker-start`
# lane takes its launch args from the HOST's agentDefaultArgs, not from any
# command this repo builds, and an env var exported here does not cross the Orca
# daemon into the worker's process. A hook nobody registers is doctrine wearing a
# script's file extension, which is the thing this catalog exists to refuse.
#
# So you wire it, per host, and `deny-hook.sh --settings <worktree>` prints the
# exact block: a PreToolUse matcher over Bash|Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|MultiEdit
# plus ORCA_UNIT_WORKTREE=<the unit's own worktree>, which gives the freeze
# boundary for free. Merge it into the settings file the worker's agent reads.
#
# State the boundary honestly when you do: this runs INSIDE the worker's session,
# so it is defense-in-depth against an improvised command, the same advisory
# status the completion gate carries — not a soundness boundary against a worker
# that sets out to defeat it. The soundness boundary is the disposable sandbox
# for the danger lane.

  cat <<'USAGE'
deny-hook.sh — PreToolUse deny/ask guard for read-write workers.

Usage: deny-hook.sh [--help] [--settings <worktree>]
  Reads a PreToolUse event JSON object on stdin; writes a decision object on
  stdout when the action is denied or must be asked, nothing when it is allowed.
  --settings <worktree> prints the settings.json block that registers this hook
  for one worker, with the boundary path resolved. Nothing registers it for you.

Environment:
  ORCA_UNIT_WORKTREE  when set, a write outside this directory is denied: the
                      Edit/Write/MultiEdit file_path or NotebookEdit
                      notebook_path, and a Bash redirect or tee destination
                      naming an absolute path.

Exit: always 0 (the decision is the output). Fail-closed: unparseable input denies.
