# pm.py — tolerant parser for `orca orchestration inbox/check` JSON output. (v3)
# Keepalives ({"_keepalive":true,...}) arrive on STDERR every 15 s — never on stdout; a capture
# that merged 2>&1 breaks naive json.load. Pipe stdout only, or filter keepalives before parsing.
# This decodes successive JSON objects, skips keepalive-only envelopes STRUCTURALLY (not by line
# filtering, which could drop a mixed keepalive+messages object), and prints each message.
#
# v3 (2026-09-10 upstream re-pin): the skip keys on `_keepalive` FIRST. A keepalive line carries
# both `_keepalive` and `_heartbeat`, but `_heartbeat` is only a deprecated alias retained for
# scripts still filtering it during migration (`check-keepalive.ts:18-26` at Orca v1.4.199) —
# v2 keyed on the alias alone, so it was correct by accident and would start miscounting every
# keepalive as an unrecognized envelope the day upstream drops it.
#
# v2 (Codex review E3 remediation): a malformed segment no longer hides everything after it —
# the parser skips to the next line and keeps going, reporting the skip count at the end.
# Missing message fields print as '?' instead of raising KeyError.
# Message text is worker-controlled and therefore untrusted: every printed field goes through
# _visible() so escape sequences (OSC 52 clipboard writes, cursor movement) print inertly — and,
# since #299, so do the characters that print NO glyph and still change what the reader sees.
#
# Usage:  orca orchestration inbox --json > inbox.json && python3 pm.py inbox.json

# Unicode general categories that change what a terminal SHOWS without printing a glyph.
#   Cf — format: U+202E right-to-left override reverses the rest of a line, U+200B zero-width
#        space splits a word the reader sees as whole, U+2066/2069 isolate a run, U+FEFF hides.
#   Zl/Zp — line and paragraph separator: a line break the renderer honours and the inbox format
#        never wrote, so a message body can forge a field of its own.
# Escaping C0/C1 alone left every one of these to reach the coordinator raw from an issue title
# or a PR body (#299). Escaped, not stripped: the reader has to SEE that something was there.
# guard_text.py knows this category too and does the opposite with it — NFKC-folds and REMOVES it
# — because that is for comparing two names, where an invisible character must not make them
# differ. Here the string is being shown to a human, so it must not silently change either.
