"""dispatch-sign.py — the COORDINATOR's out-of-band signer for #135 (native-hook soundness).

The native Stop/TaskCompleted hook runs IN the graded worker's session, so the worker controls the
env (`ORCA_CONTRACT_DIGEST`, `ORCA_UNIT_CLASS`, …) and could substitute a weaker denominator or
downgrade its class. To make the native path SOUND, the coordinator — which runs OFF the worker
(a separate session, CI, or the human's machine) and holds a private key the worker never sees —
signs the dispatch tuple at dispatch time. The gate (verify.py) verifies that signature against the
repo-pinned PUBLIC key, so an in-session substitution is detected.

    dispatch-sign.py gen-key --out ~/.orca-fleet/dispatch-key
        # writes the 32-byte seed to <out> (keep OFF the worker AND out of this repo) and the
        # public key to <out>.pub; commit <out>.pub as .orca/dispatch-pubkey to turn on
        # enforcement (docs/verify-gate.md). gen-key refuses to write a seed inside a git work
        # tree unless the path is git-ignored (or --in-repo-ok is given).

    dispatch-sign.py sign --key ~/.orca-fleet/dispatch-key \\
        --manifest-id <unit-id> --contract-digest sha256:… --unit-class mutation [--lighting lit] \\
        [--nc-path src/app.py --nc-command "pytest -k AC_1" --nc-artifact-sha256 <hex>]
        # prints the signed envelope JSON the gate consumes via --dispatch-record.
        # The --nc-* inputs are OPTIONAL and cover the negative control itself (#311): signing the
        # class and the contract binds the denominator but leaves the worker choosing its own
        # oracle. Sign them when the coordinator knows the control at dispatch time; when it does
        # not — the usual case, since the fix has not been written yet — the gate binds the same
        # inputs to what base_sha..head_sha actually changes instead (#280).

    dispatch-sign.py sign-transcript --key ~/.orca-fleet/dispatch-key \\
        --transcript <verdict.json> [--out <transcript.json>]
        # wraps verify.py's VERDICT OBJECT (what `verify.py --transcript-out` writes) in the same
        # {record, sig_b64} envelope, over the same canonical form, with the same key (#281/#386).
        # For the custody model where the seed is OFFLINE: verify.py runs without it, the
        # maintainer signs the verdict afterwards. run_report.py then requires the envelope to
        # verify against the committed .orca/dispatch-pubkey — the same pin that switches the
        # dispatch-record check on. `verify.py --transcript-key` signs in-process instead — on
        # a host that never ran the executed control (verify.py refuses --execute-nc with it;
        # h409 F-6). SIGN ONLY A VERDICT OBJECT YOU PRODUCED: this signer checks shape, not
        # truth — the one content check it makes is that `toolchain.files` hashes THESE
        # scripts, so a verdict from another verifier is refused (h409 O-2.4).

Stdlib-only; the signature scheme is runtime/scripts/ed25519.py (vendored, RFC 8032).
