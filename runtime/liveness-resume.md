# Runtime policy — liveness and crash-resume

The runtime tracks everything needed to keep a long run alive and recoverable, but it only WARNS on stalls;
the fleet must act. Both live-supervision and crash-resume read the same persisted provenance (tasks,
dispatch_contexts with last_heartbeat_at/failure_count, worker_done payloads — all in SQLite, surviving
restarts).

## Provenance is `taskId`+`dispatchId`, never the handle

Lifecycle authority is the payload's `taskId`+`dispatchId` verified against the dispatched pane — NOT a
terminal-handle comparison. A pane can receive a new handle after a restart, so never accept or reject a
`worker_done`/`heartbeat` by matching handles; the runtime ignores a lifecycle message sent from a different
pane than the one that owns the dispatch. When a handle returns `terminal_handle_stale`, re-resolve it with
`terminal list --worktree … --json` and continue with the replacement ONLY — never dual-send to the old and
new handles.

## Liveness authority: the projection, not the pane

`worker-list` is the ENUMERATING command and the authority on agent liveness. Each row carries
`projection.liveness` (the fleet verdict), `projection.attention.categories`,
`projection.attention.requiresAction`, and a literal `projection.nextAction.argv` to run. `worker-show`'s
`observation.status` is **PTY liveness only** — a `live` terminal can still hold an agent that died at a trust
prompt (`orchestration/recovery-and-cleanup:25-31` at v1.4.199). The fleet taught this inverted for two runs;
it is the reason pane-reading felt authoritative.

Always scope it: `worker-list --run <run_id>`. Unscoped, it reports every Dispatch this runtime ever recorded
and buries the live ones.

Two states the old vocabulary lacked, and neither is a failure:

- **`outcome_unknown`** — the start neither proved nor disproved the worker. Inspect, then choose
  `worker-stop` or an explicit `worker-abandon`. `spawn_worker.sh` exits **4** here and prints the receipt's
  `nextCommands`.
- **`unverifiable`** — absence, not a verdict (`missing_status`, `stale_status`, `restored_unconfirmed`,
  `host_unavailable`, a remote worker with no connection). Absence **authorizes nothing**: never stop,
  abandon, retry, or release on it. Keep waiting or inspect.

Leave a wait only on POSITIVE proof the agent stopped: `exited` liveness, the worker's own observation of
process exit, or a transcript whose final agent turn sent no `worker_done`.

## WATCH (self-healing while alive)

- Poll `check --wait --types worker_done,escalation,question` ({count:0} timeout is a checkup tick, not an
  error). `--types` is only the WAKE condition — the Delivery still carries the whole FIFO batch, so process
  every message before `--ack` (orca-dag-semantics.md). Keepalives (`{"_keepalive":true,…}`) go to **stderr**,
  never stdout — pipe stdout only into parsers (`runtime/scripts/pm.py <file>` for saved stdout streams).
- **After 3 empty waits, ask the runtime instead of guessing:** `worker-list --run <id> --json`, then act on
  every row whose `attention.requiresAction` is true by executing its literal `nextAction.argv` (`inspect` /
  `release` / `recover`). That argv is the runtime's own answer; running it beats any heuristic the fleet
  could write. A `nextAction` naming an INSPECTING command is asking for evidence, not authorizing cleanup.
- End-of-run gate: `worker-list --run <id> --terminal-state reclaimable` — while any row is reclaimable,
  something still owes a decision. That, not a clean inbox, is "nothing outstanding".
- Respawn a dead worker: log the evidence + a doctor-owned attempt count (NOT the runtime failure budget) →
  **reflection-before-retry** (below) → `task-update → ready` ONLY after the evidence line → `worker-start
  --task <id> --retry-of <failed dispatch id>` with an explicit fresh placement (`--worktree` / `--agent` /
  `--terminal` — retry never silently inherits the dead placement). spawn_worker.sh's contract: exit 2 = usage
  or policy refusal (bad args, unknown agent, unmet deps, danger without opt-in) — SURFACE the refusal, never
  retry it as an uncounted re-triage; every typed orchestration refusal (`task_not_found`,
  `task_not_startable` with `data.unmetDependencies`, `inject_rejected`, `nested_worker_depth_exceeded`,
  `consumer_fenced`, `dispatch_inactive`) branches the same way and carries `error.data.nextSteps` — read it.
  Exit 4 (`outcome_unknown`) is INSPECT, never respawn. Exit 3 (custom-argv lane: input accepted, turn start
  unproven) is a POSSIBLE false negative — READ THE PANE before respawning, with `orca terminal read
  --terminal <h> --screen` or `worker-read --dispatch <id>`, not by eye: a live TUI is a working worker, and
  respawning beside it creates a dual-writer (dispatch-lifecycle.md).
- BREAK at 3 doctor attempts OR the dispatch-context circuit break (3 consecutive failures marks the task
  failed) → escalate honestly (gate-classification.md).
- **Identical-error kill:** if the last ≥2 doctor attempts failed on the same error signature (same failing
  command + same primary error token), do NOT retry the same approach — kill, reassign to a fresh worker with
  a rewritten TASK, or park. Counted toward the 3-attempt cap.
- Re-confirm `ORCA_COORD_ALLOW_DANGER` before respawning a danger-profile worker.
- Lost preamble ≠ dead worker: regenerate the exact preamble with `dispatch-show --task <id> --preamble` (it
  is derived deterministically from the current task spec) and replay the receipt with `terminal send
  --retry-request <id> --wait-submit <secs>`. Receipted sends shipped in v1.4.199
  (`terminal-send.ts:8,19-22`): a timeout returns the input-accepted receipt and never resends. NEVER
  blind-re-Enter — `accepted: true` proves input acceptance, not a started turn, and the rule is never resend
  on silence.
- A worker blocked on a human prompt shows `observation.agentWait` — a gate-classification problem, not a
  respawn (null and absent differ: absent means the host never reported).
- NEVER run `orca orchestration reset` mid-run — it wipes the task/dispatch state every recovery path below
  depends on. There is no mid-run situation it fixes that WATCH/RESUME doesn't.

## Reflection-before-retry (mandatory on doctor respawn)

Before every doctor-owned respawn, append to the unit's evidence / ledger:

```
REFLECTION: what failed? · what specific change would fix it? · am I repeating the same approach?
```

A respawn without that line is invalid — write it first. If the honest answer to the third question is yes,
apply the identical-error kill (reassign or park), do not loop.

## The stuck-pending watchdog (a runtime trap)

**Corrected:** `task-create` DOES validate `--deps` since upstream #9925 — a missing or foreign-Run dep throws
`Dependency task <id> must belong to run <run>` (`task-store.ts:38-43` at v1.4.199). The typo'd-dep strand
this file used to warn about cannot happen; a fleet that budgeted for it was defending a closed hole.

The other half is CURRENT and is the real trap: `promoteReadyTasks` fires only when a dep COMPLETES, and
requires every dep `completed`. A dep that ends **`failed`** therefore strands the child in `pending` FOREVER
— and convergence detection only flags `blocked`, never `pending`. That strand is permanent: it is not a retry
of the child. Every fleet keeps the watchdog for it — any task `pending` past a threshold with an unmet or
failed dep is surfaced, never silently waited on. Edges are `deps`; `parent_id` exists but the fleet does not
set it (orca-dag-semantics.md).

## Scope is never "the whole database"

The orchestration DB mixes every run on the machine. WATCH and RESUME operate only on the run's scope: the
**Run id** from the ledger header (`task-list --run`, `worker-list --run`, `check` all honor it) plus the
ledger's task ids. Unfiltered `task-list` is a discovery tool, not the run.

## The ledger header (every mission writes it; RESUME depends on it)

The FIRST line of every mission's ledger file is a header, written at run start and updated on coordinator
respawn:

`RUN: <orchestration Run id from run-create> · COORDINATOR: <terminal handle(s)> · BASE: <integration branch,
or '-' for report-only/planning missions> · FORK_POINT: <sha BASE was created from, or '-'> · T0: <ts> ·
SOURCE: <mission denominator ref + digest> · WIP: builders=<n> reviewers=<n>`

`RUN` and `COORDINATOR` are always required (RESUME dies without them); fields a mission class has no value
for are recorded as `-`, never omitted (a missing column is indistinguishable from a truncated header). `WIP`
is the run's attention cap (attention-budget.md — class defaults unless measured); a header without it
predates this field, and RESUME writes the class default back in before dispatching anything.

A ledger with rows but no header is a resume-orphan — recoverable only by hand.

Unit **boolean flags**, park classes (`CODE_CLOSED` / `VERIFY_AT_SCALE`), `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and the
**CONTEXT HANDOFF** block under compaction pressure: ledger-contract.md. RESUME always re-reads those before
trusting memory.

## RESUME (coordinator died)

Run scope is mandatory: the Run id + task ids from the ledger header. Everything else is
counted-but-untouched; no scope → resume ABORTS.

1. FREEZE-check: no other live coordinator.
2. Bind the run: the new coordinator adopts it with `run-use --id <run>` — and if the run predates an Orca
   contract update (legacy rows, authority labels on its mail), take it over explicitly with `run-use --id
   <run> --takeover-legacy` **from the live coordinator terminal** (upstream's adoption protocol preserves
   live workers' dispatches, processes, and filesystems and routes their later questions to the current
   coordinator — an Orca upgrade mid-run is no longer a hand-recovery). A dispatch re-attaching under a new
   coordinator shows `consumer_fenced`; the fenced old coordinator's mutations are rejected. Caveats that make
   the takeover safe: never take over while the ORIGINAL coordinator is still active (that is the dual-writer
   class with extra steps); `--from` cannot nominate the taker, so it must be run from the terminal that will
   hold the run; `run_legacy_local` is an empty tombstone, so find the Run whose objective reads `Recovered
   orchestration work from a contract update`; and when authority is unproven, degrade to read-only inspection
   rather than adopting (`orchestration/legacy-contract-migration:19-23,69-83` at v1.4.199).
3. REBUILD from provenance; CROSS-VERIFY every "completed" against git (evidence-manifest.md) —
   provenance-says-done + git-disagrees = SUSPECT (treat as failed).
4. RECONCILE the ledger (git is truth, the ledger is its cache).
5. RE-ENTER the mission loop at the DAG frontier; never re-do a verified-merged unit.

## Inflation post-mortem (re-runs — the Aula lesson)

SUSPECT covers crash-resume inside one run; this covers run N+1. A run re-entering a surface a PRIOR run
reported done starts by re-reading that run's completion report and listing every claim whose proof was "CI
green" rather than a verified end state as the FIRST items of the new work index, re-confirmed OPEN until the
verifier passes them against authoritative state. An autonomous run will otherwise believe its own green
checkmarks — anti-inflation has to be structural, not a reminder.
