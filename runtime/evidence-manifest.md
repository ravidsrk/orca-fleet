# Runtime policy — the evidence manifest (the definition of done)

This is how a fleet knows a unit of work is actually DONE. It replaces trace-grading, which a coordinator cannot
enforce: it does not hold its workers' traces, and a trace proves an action attempted, not the resulting state.

Completion is a two-part protocol: the worker emits a **SHA-bound evidence manifest**, and an **independent verifier**
checks its claims against **authoritative state** (git, the test runner in a clean env, the runtime, the deploy
target). A unit advances only when verification passes.

## 1. The manifest (every worker emits this in `worker_done`)

The worker writes it to the path the dispatcher passed as Orca's typed `--report-path` flag, and names that path in
the `worker_done` payload. Shape (JSON; a mission may add fields):

```json

Field scoping by mission class: `base_branch`, `pr`, `review` and the revert/mutate form of `negative_control` are
MUTATION-ONLY — report-only and planning units omit them. A report-only unit's verdict binds to `head_sha` (the SHA it
reviewed); its `negative_control` carries §3's class analogue (review-it: re-read every quoted line at head_sha).

Rules:
- `base_sha` and `head_sha` are REQUIRED on every class. Mutation units: pinned 40-hex real commits ("It works" with no SHA is not a manifest); other classes: a symbolic ref is NOTE-only.
- `contract` binds the manifest to THIS UNIT's authoritative denominator — the unit's task spec as materialized at
  decompose/enumeration time (a slice's criteria, a finding, an advisory), not worker-chosen. It is TWO-LEVEL:
  - **unit level** (this field): `contract.criterion_ids` is the COMPLETE id set of the unit's own task spec at
    `contract.digest`; `criteria` must carry an entry for every one — a worker cannot shrink its denominator; the
    verifier re-derives it (§2) and rejects a manifest that drops any id.
  - **mission level** (the coordinator's job, not the worker's): the UNION of all unit contracts must equal the
    mission's authoritative source (frozen spec criterion set / tracker enumeration / advisory scan). A criterion no
    unit's contract claims is UNASSIGNED WORK, surfaced at decompose verification and re-checked in the mission's
    convergence proof (e.g. ship-it's traceability table). This split is what makes a narrow slice completable: the
    slice proves ITS criteria; the mission proves nothing was left off any slice.
  For loop-based denominators (`clean-sweep source=tracker`) the two digests stay separate: the unit's
  `contract.digest` is always its OWN task spec; the ENUMERATION digest is mission state (ledger header's SOURCE
  field, re-derived each loop). The FINAL loop's enumeration is the mission denominator — a post-`T0` issue joins
  the next loop's set; verified units stay verified.
- `criteria` lists the ACTUAL acceptance criteria from the task spec, each marked addressed or not. A criterion with no addressing evidence is unmet work, not a waiver.
- **Evidence paths are repo-relative and PINNED.** Every path the manifest names (`negative_control.artifact`,
  `review.artifact`, `artifacts[]`) resolves inside the git toplevel — absolute, or escaping it, is refused — AND its
  bytes are fixed: the path is TRACKED at `head_sha` (the immutable form; the blob at that commit is what gets read),
  or its sha256 is listed in `artifacts[]` and matches. Untracked and unhashed is a claim ABOUT a file, not evidence.
- `negative_control` is REQUIRED for any unit that claims a fix or a test: show the proof FAILS when the change is
  reverted/mutated (a green test over reverted code proves nothing). Bind it to a NAMED mutation tool + a PINNED
  mutant id with a killed/survived verdict — a surviving criterion-violating mutant is a tautological suite and FAILS.
  Tools: `mutmut`/`cosmic-ray`/`stryker`/`pitest`/`cargo-mutants`/`go-mutesting` (per language), `hand` (compile-
  preserving hand-written mutant, diff quoted in the artifact), or `revert` (restore `paths` from `base_sha`).
  `command` + (for `revert`) `paths` make it RE-EXECUTABLE — §2's `--execute-nc` applies the control in a throwaway
  worktree at `head_sha` and requires `command` to exit NON-ZERO there and ZERO at clean `head_sha`; both are REQUIRED
  in the review-waiver lanes (`dark-eligible`, `--no-gh`), where the control is the only oracle and an artifact nobody
  ran is just text. Carve-outs: a perf fix compares before/after to the metric contract; a behaviour-preserving
  deepening (reshape-it) proves the seam's pinned mutant stays KILLED at head_sha AND reverting enlarges the interface
  measurement; a doctrine patch (pin-it) archives the pre-patch refutation receipt (the old claim's probe RED, tool
  `revert`), re-run post-merge.
- **Coordinator oracle scope:** test-only characterization and documentation units may put `oracle_scope` in the
  coordinator's digest-bound JSON contract (never the worker manifest): `{"kind":"characterization", "base_sha":"…",
  "head_sha":"…", "criterion_ids":["AC-1"], "paths":{"app.py":[2]}, "artifact_sha256":"<raw artifact sha256>"}`.
  `kind` is `characterization` or `documentation`; bind the exact commit pair, every criterion, explicit head-line numbers,
  and the exact hand-mutant artifact hash. The coordinator authorizes this concrete scope after inspecting the mutant.
  Characterization changes tests/prose only; documentation changes prose only. Tests, runner configuration, Makefiles and named proof-command inputs
  remain forbidden targets. Without this scope the production-change bind remains mandatory; every replay requires an assertion failure and clean-head success.
- `binding_audit` logs criterion↔test coverage for the same units: which `criteria[].id`s had their covering test quoted and mutation-checked against the criterion (§2 samples it; a fix/test manifest without it fails).
- `commands` pastes real invocations + exit codes with artifact paths — never a summary. Produce them with
  `runtime/scripts/evidence-run.py --label L --manifest m.json -- <cmd>`: a transparent wrapper (the child's exit code
  always passes through) that appends the record above, fingerprinting the tree with `wtree.sh` BEFORE the run. That
  fingerprint binds a run to content — §2 needs an exit-0 record whose `wtree` is `head_sha`'s tree; anything else is STALE.
- `pr.reviewed_sha` is the SHA the build-blind reviewer actually reviewed (see reviewed-sha-freshness.md). It gates the merge.
- `review.artifact` (path to the local reviewer record at head_sha) is REQUIRED on a mutation unit in the no-gh lane (dispatch `--no-gh`; merge-serialization.md) — the coordinator-attested stand-in for §2's GitHub review lookup. The gh lane and report-only/planning units omit it.
- `intent` is REQUIRED on mutation units: goal · ruled_out · why, all non-empty — discarded agent reasoning captured (not the completion oracle; that stays §2). A missing or empty packet fails verification.
- `lighting` is `lit` (default) or `dark-eligible` per gate-classification.md. The verifier machine-checks only that the value is legal and unswapped against the dispatch-supplied value (plus, via the review leg, that a `dark-eligible` unit carries a corroborating out-of-band coordinator contract). The stop-list / Lane-0/B decision is a human gate at dispatch — verify.py never sees lane data.
- `provenance` (optional, any class) makes the manifest a regulated audit record — governing spec/policy version, model lineage, reviewer identity+timestamp, and an append-only retention pointer (maps to EU AI Act Art-12/50). When it names a standard (not `none`) the verifier REQUIRES those fields — an incomplete packet is not a valid audit record.
- `claim` is the worker's narration — the verifier ignores it except as a hint.

## 2. Independent verification (the coordinator, or a fresh verifier worker)

A DIFFERENT process/session — never a teammate (whose messages are in-band and self-certifying) — re-derives the manifest
against authoritative state that lives OUTSIDE it: the coordinator's frozen contract (scope), GitHub (review), git, and
the EXECUTED negative control — deterministically, before any LLM judgment (impl: `verify.py`; the runnable command line, with its lane flags, is in build-change.md "The invocation"). Manifest = claim; these are facts:

| Check | How (authoritative source) |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Unit scope is complete — no dropped criteria (do this FIRST) | re-derive the criterion id set from the COORDINATOR's authoritative `contract.source` @ `contract.digest` **as recorded in the dispatch record**, never the worker's manifest (a manifest cannot certify its own denominator; a manifest `contract.digest` that differs from the authoritative one is a denominator swap), and confirm `criteria[].id` covers it EXACTLY. Scope, pinned commit identities, signature/signed NC inputs and evidence validity are checked before any NC worktree, patch or command is run; rejection executes nothing. Rejected before any test is checked — passing tests on a shrunken denominator is a false "done" |
| Mission scope is complete — no unassigned criteria (coordinator, at decompose verify + convergence proof) | the union of all unit `contract.criterion_ids` equals the mission source's id set (frozen spec digest / final enumeration loop / advisory scan). A criterion claimed by no unit is unassigned work, not a waiver |
| The commit exists on the intended base *(mutation units)* | `git merge-base --is-ancestor <head_sha> origin/<base_branch>` after the merge; before merge, `git cat-file -e <head_sha>` and the PR's `baseRefName == base_branch` *(coordinator-run — not verify.py, which checks ancestry/existence only)* |
| Tests really ran on THIS content — the content-bound ledger *(verify.py `check_commands`)* | `commands[]` carries ≥1 record with `exit == 0` whose `wtree` equals `git rev-parse <head_sha>^{tree}` — written by `evidence-run.py`, which hashes the command and fingerprints the tree itself. FAIL-CLOSED: no record, or only records made on other content (STALE), fails the unit. This is the worker's own runner, so it does not replace the clean-env re-run below; it makes "tests passed at that SHA" checkable instead of narrated |
| Tests pass at that exact SHA in a clean env *(coordinator-run — not verify.py)* | check out `head_sha` in a fresh worktree, run the suite, confirm green — do NOT trust the pasted output alone for the critical path |
| No credential reached the evidence *(verify.py `check_redaction`)* | the manifest JSON and every artifact it names are scanned for credential shapes (AWS keys, `ghp_`/`github_pat_`, private-key blocks, `password=`/`secret=` with a value, Slack tokens) — built-in patterns always, plus Gitleaks when installed; every consumer uses the same pinned bytes. Unreadable named evidence fails closed. A hit FAILS the unit: a SHA-pinned manifest is permanent, so rotate and re-emit |
| Each criterion binds to a test that exercises it — criterion↔test binding audit *(coordinator/human sample — not verify.py)* | on a sample of `criteria[].id`s (ALL of them when the unit has ≤3): quote the criterion, quote the test claimed to cover it, and confirm that test goes RED against an implementation that violates the criterion (mutate the behavior the criterion names via the manifest's named mutation tool — the pinned mutant must be KILLED; build-change.md's tautology guard covers authoring, this is its verifier-side twin). A green suite whose tests don't bind (tautological, wrong behavior, passes both ways) fails HERE, not at the clean-env re-run; coverage is logged in the manifest's `binding_audit` |
| The negative control really fails — EXECUTED, not read | mutation units, `--execute-nc`: verify.py checks out `head_sha` in a throwaway worktree, APPLIES the control (`revert`: `git checkout <base_sha> -- <negative_control.paths>`, falling back to `git revert --no-commit base..head` only when no paths are given and the range is linear; `hand`: `git apply` the diff quoted in the artifact), and requires `negative_control.command` to exit NON-ZERO there — then ZERO in a second clean worktree at `head_sha`. That command is NOT the unit's to choose: the coordinator supplies it out of band as `--nc-command` and the manifest must agree, with no fallback (#279). The `commands[]` ledger was that fallback until `evidence-run.py` was seen for what it is — a worker-run recorder — making manifest and ledger one authority twice, neither able to license the other. A worker that nominates its own command picks one failing under the control and passing clean (`grep -q FIXED calc.py` will do) and clears this gate without ever running the proof. The control must BIND TO THE CHANGE (#280): the paths it restores — and every endpoint in a `hand` diff — must be production paths `base_sha..head_sha` really changes (except the coordinator oracle scope above), with every edited coordinate bound to the Git-applied diff before running the proof (offset relocation is refused); context cannot authorize a mutant, nor can a decoy or TEST/runner-config path (reverting the test kills the oracle, not the behaviour); the range fallback is refused at admission when the unit touches test/oracle inputs; and the RED must carry an assertion failure, not an ImportError (a STILLBORN MUTANT) or silence. A command that passes under the control is TAUTOLOGICAL and fails; so does a control that changes nothing, a tool with no replay, a missing command, or any git error. The static artifact is still read for corroboration (a "survived / not killed" artifact fails) but is NEVER sufficient alone — it is worker-written text. Report-only/planning units: the class analogue of §3 is re-checked (quoted lines exist at reviewed_sha / the frozen DAG re-verifies / the repro command re-runs red) |
| The review is fresh AND real *(mutation units)* | `pr.reviewed_sha == head_sha` (a rebase after review voids it — reviewed-sha-freshness.md — unless `reviewed_wtree` matches the head's tree, i.e. the move was content-identical) AND an independent APPROVED review at `head_sha` looked up on GitHub (`gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews`) — a worker-set `reviewed_sha` is not evidence a review occurred — AND **no** independent reviewer's latest review within this content's history is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`: derive equivalent trees from all authoritative review commits, regardless of the worker's selected SHA, and fail closed on unresolved objects. A later unrelated review cannot withdraw a relevant objection; COMMENTED/DISMISSED on equivalent content can. A second approval cannot override it (#317) |
| The review-WAIVER lanes are closed to text | `dark-eligible` (gate-classification.md) and the no-gh lane (dispatch `--no-gh`, whose review is the manifest's `review.artifact`, a local record at head_sha) both remove the GitHub authority, leaving the negative control as the ONLY oracle. Both therefore pass ONLY with an EXECUTED control (`--execute-nc`) on top of the out-of-band coordinator contract; without it the unit is RED with a message naming the lane. Six of the ten manifest-gaming attacks in the 2026-09-10 review landed here, on artifacts nobody ran |
| The change is real on base *(mutation units)* | after merge, a file/symbol from the unit is greppable on `origin/<base_branch>` |
| Deployed == reviewed (ship only) *(coordinator-verified)* | the deployed revision equals the reviewed/merged SHA |
| The metric contract is met (measurement units) | the benchmark/coverage/streak satisfies the manifest's `metric_contract` (pre-declared target + confidence + method), not a lucky single run |
| The review was independent | `reviewer_mode` is recorded AND machine-checked for a legal value (verify.py); whether reviewer/verifier artifacts are byte-identical to (or trivially derived from) the worker's own output is a COORDINATOR judgment — a predecessor's flagship run was quarantined on exactly this; instructed isolation is named as the weaker guarantee it is |
| Intent packet is present *(mutation units)* | `intent.goal`, `intent.ruled_out`, and `intent.why` are non-empty strings — presence only; wisdom is a human/taste check |
| Lighting is legal | `lighting` is `lit` or `dark-eligible` AND matches the dispatch-supplied value — a swap fails (verify.py); the Lane A / unfakeable-oracle / stop-list eligibility itself is a human gate at dispatch (gate-classification.md), not machine-checked |

Verification failing on any required check → the unit is NOT done; it returns to its state machine (re-dispatch,
or SUSPECT if provenance says done but git disagrees).

At run close the coordinator writes an **integrity inventory** beside the final report: sha256 + producer + timestamp for
every artifact the run's manifests reference (§1's per-unit `artifacts[]` hashes are its per-unit half). RESUME and any
later audit reject an artifact whose hash no longer matches.

## 3. Standing definition-of-done floor (every mission, on top of its own contract)

A unit is done only when its own acceptance criteria AND this floor both hold. The floor is scoped by MISSION
CLASS — a negative control is always required, but what one IS differs:

- **Mutation units** (ship-it, clean-sweep, oss-contribute, harden-it, speed-it, modernize-it, prove-it, deflake-it,
  access-it, pin-it, floor-it, reshape-it, field-test-it, migrate-it, oncall-it, absorb-it, document-it): runtime-verified, not just compiled/typechecked; no new red at head SHA; the negative control is the §1 proof, EXECUTED per §2.
- **Report-only units** (review-it): no code is touched (that IS a checked invariant — a dirty worktree fails the
  unit); the negative-control analogue is SOURCE-BINDING: every finding quotes a line that exists at `head_sha`
  (the SHA reviewed), and the verdict binds to that SHA. A finding whose quoted line does not exist there is a
  fabricated finding — the unit fails.
- **Planning units** (map-it, root-cause diagnosis): the negative-control analogue is ARTIFACT VERIFICATION: the frozen
  DAG passes decompose-dag's verify section / the reproduction command was actually run and its failing output is pasted;
  a decision ticket answered by the agent instead of the human fails the unit.
- **Every class**: evidence exists (the manifest is present and SHA-bound) and parked is named — anything not done is PARKED with a reason and a gate, never silently dropped.
