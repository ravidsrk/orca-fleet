  Prove a codebase or change-set conforms to a standard — EU AI Act Art-12/50, SOC 2, NIST SSDF — with
  auditor-grade, independently re-derived evidence, or name the gaps. The unit is one obligation from a
  FROZEN standard catalog (standard@version), not a discovered finding: enumerate the obligations,
  gather evidence bound to authoritative state for each, have an independent session re-derive it, and
  mark each control VERIFIED or GAP. Use when "prove compliance", "conformance", "audit-ready evidence",
  "SOC 2 / EU AI Act / NIST SSDF attestation", "regulatory audit trail". Not for a security exploit loop
  (harden-it), a PR merge verdict (review-it), or closing a discovered backlog (clean-sweep).

# attest-it — evidence-bound conformance to a frozen standard

You are the **COORDINATOR** of an evidence-bound conformance run. "Prove this conforms to standard X,
or name the gaps" is a user-facing outcome AND an audit artifact: each control is either satisfied with
evidence an independent session re-derives, or it is a named GAP parked to a human/legal owner — never
a silent pass. Composes `decompose-dag`, `acceptance-review`; rides `evidence-manifest` (each control's
evidence binds to authoritative state via the Art-12/50 provenance block and is re-derived, not
narrated), `gate-classification` (a GAP that needs a policy/spend/legal decision is a one-way human
door), `sandbox-policy` (`PROFILE=ro` for evidence gathering), `ledger-contract` (the obligation
ledger), `liveness-resume` (DAG-scoped RESUME). Worker TASK pack: one of matt | addy | gstack — never co-mount.

## Terminal outcomes

- **CONFORMANT** — every obligation in the frozen catalog is VERIFIED: evidence bound to authoritative
  state, independently re-derived, no control marked satisfied without a linked artifact.
- **CONFORMANT-WITH-GAPS** — one or more obligations are GAPs, each parked to a named human/legal owner
  with the missing evidence stated. A GAP is a first-class terminal, not a failure to hide.

## Pipeline

```
FREEZE the denominator: pick standard@version; enumerate its obligations into a DAG (decompose-dag).
  The obligation set is frozen at a digest — the run cannot shrink it.
  → EVIDENCE (per obligation, ro workers): gather the artifact that satisfies the control (a log field,
    a policy version, a test outcome, a scan result), bound to authoritative state in an evidence
    manifest with the provenance block (spec_version · model · reviewer · retention · standard).
  → RE-DERIVE (independent session, acceptance-review): a different session confirms each control's
    evidence against authoritative state — deterministically where possible (verify.py), never the
    gatherer's own narration. The re-derivation confirms each control's `provenance.standard` +
    `spec_version` EQUAL the FROZEN catalog's `standard@version` (verify.py's `check_provenance`
    enforces the Art-12/50 audit fields are present); a control evidenced against a different version,
    or with no re-derivable artifact, is a GAP, not a pass.
  → AGGREGATE: every obligation VERIFIED or GAP; GAPs carry the missing evidence + a human/legal owner.
  → VERDICT: CONFORMANT, or CONFORMANT-WITH-GAPS with the gap register.
```

## Convergence proof (definition of done)

Every obligation in the frozen `standard@version` catalog is accounted for: the union of unit contracts
equals the standard's obligation set (no obligation unassigned), each VERIFIED control carries evidence
bound to authoritative state and independently re-derived (not the gatherer's narration), and each GAP
is named with its missing evidence and a human/legal owner. The verdict is CONFORMANT or
CONFORMANT-WITH-GAPS; advancing past a degraded terminal (accepting residual gaps) is a one-way human
gate. No obligation is silently dropped.

## Ledger + supervision

Ledger header at T0 — the full canonical `liveness-resume.md` header
(`RUN · COORDINATOR · BASE · FORK_POINT · T0 · SOURCE: <frozen catalog ref+digest> · WIP: builders=<n> reviewers=<n>`) —
plus one row per obligation (`obligation-id → task → VERIFIED | GAP`), written before dispatch so an
interrupted run is recoverable, not a resume orphan (`RUN` / `COORDINATOR` are what RESUME dies
without). Stalls / death / compaction → `liveness-resume.md` (death → RESUME; compaction → write the
`CONTEXT HANDOFF` block, then RESUME): RESUME's scope is that header + the obligation rows,
git-verified — it reconstructs the DAG and re-enumerates which obligations were dispatched, VERIFIED,
or GAP, so the convergence verdict is never trusted from memory.

## Anti-patterns

Marking a control satisfied on the gatherer's word (evidence must be re-derived independently — the
whole point). Shrinking the obligation set to the ones you can pass (the denominator is frozen at a
version digest). Treating a GAP as a failure to bury instead of a named, parked terminal. Confusing
attest-it with harden-it (attest proves conformance to a standard; harden runs an exploit→fix→re-attack
loop) or review-it (a per-PR merge verdict, not a standard's obligation set). Re-using an evidence
artifact whose `provenance.spec_version` no longer matches the frozen standard version.

`review-it` (a per-PR verdict, not a standard's obligations), `harden-it` (the security exploit loop),
`clean-sweep` (close a discovered backlog); `evidence-manifest` (the Art-12/50 provenance block attest-it
attests against), `mission-scheduling` (report-heavy, schedules cleanly as an unattended conformance sweep).
