  Stand up a per-workspace environment recipe end to end: interview the human for connection
  mode, provider, agent, and git auth, scaffold the lifecycle scripts and state file, build the
  base snapshot and the agent-auth snapshot, wire the environmentRecipes entry, and loop the
  recipe doctor dry-run plus live provision self-test until both pass — paid checkpoints gated
  on explicit human OKs, the interactive agent login left to the human. The unit is one recipe.
  Use when "run this in the cloud", "set up a sandbox recipe", "per-workspace environment",
  "orca vm recipe doctor fails", "provision ephemeral dev environments". Not for placing one
  worker on an existing host (orchestration), proving app behaviour on a fresh box
  (field-test-it CLEAN-ENV), or re-pinning runtime doctrine (pin-it).

  HARD dependency: Orca runtime + orchestration skill (Orca CLI) with vm recipe doctor. A
  provider account + CLI with a sandbox/VM plan, and the provider's own docs for its verbs. An
  agent CLI + account for the auth snapshot. git + gh. One worker playbook pack per worker
  (matt or addy) — never two routers in one worker.

# offload-it — a recipe that provisions, proven by provisioning

You are the **COORDINATOR** of a recipe stand-up run. "Give this repo a working Run-on option"
is a user-facing outcome whose proof is enactment, not review: the doctor is clear AND a live
provision ran create→validate→destroy end to end. The phases run in FIXED ORDER — the auth
snapshot boots from the base snapshot, and create boots from the authenticated image — and the
money and the login are the human's: each paid checkpoint proceeds only on an explicit OK, and
the interactive agent login runs in the human's own terminal. Composes `human-handoff` (paid
checkpoints and the interactive login are human grants with verify-complete observations),
`research-brief` (the provider's exact create/exec/snapshot/remove verbs are read from its own
docs before scaffolding); rides `evidence-manifest` (each recipe carries its doctor transcript,
snapshot ids, and provision transcript), `gate-classification` (paid steps are one-way doors),
`sandbox-policy` (PROFILE=rw; secrets never land in scripts, userData, state, or commits).
Worker TASK pack: one of matt | addy — never co-mount.

## Terminal outcomes

- **OFFLOADED** — the doctor is clear (no fail AND no warn) and the provision loop is green end
  to end; state holds the AUTHENTICATED snapshot id; destroy is implemented and tested.
- **OFFLOADED-WITH-PARKED** — ≥1 park, each naming its checkpoint: a provider quota or plan cap
  (with the upgrade or smaller-scope ask), an unauthenticated agent login (the human re-runs
  device-auth), or an interactive step the human has not run yet.

## Pipeline

```
INSPECT the repo for an existing entry, scripts, state, or setup notes — a working recipe goes
  straight to the doctor loop, never a rebuild.
→ INTERVIEW, settled FIRST and confirmed back, never picked by the fleet: connection mode
  (Orca-server vs SSH — it changes the create output and half the templates), provider plus
  scope/project/region/plan, agent CLI plus account, git token source.
→ PREREQUISITES: provider CLI installed and authed, caps recorded (a 45-minute sandbox cap
  limits the base build AND the per-workspace runtime); each item marked verified or asserted.
→ SCAFFOLD scripts + state under scripts/orca-vm/, executable, stdout reserved for the final
  JSON object; every script resolves values env → state → fallback and merges outputs back.
→ BASE-SNAPSHOT [CHECKPOINT: explicit OK — paid and slow]: build headless main only, clone via
  a GIT_ASKPASS helper (rm'd after), trap errors so a crash removes the half-built environment,
  snapshot the STOPPED machine, parse the id into state. Never snapshot a machine where the
  runtime already ran — shared pairing identity; delete the verified user-data dir first.
→ AGENT-AUTH [CHECKPOINT: the human runs the device-auth login, then says so]: headless means
  device-auth flow only (plain login hangs on an unreachable loopback callback); verify by the
  status command's EXIT CODE, never grep-for-logged-in; refuse to snapshot unauthenticated.
  [CHECKPOINT: explicit OK — the re-snapshot is paid, and the login words above do not cover
  it]: re-snapshot, overwrite snapshotId, record authSourceSnapshotId, remove the auth
  environment.
→ WIRE orca.yaml create/suspend/resume/destroy at the scripts. The composer reads recipes from
  the PRIMARY checkout — a recipe that lives only on a branch never appears as Run-on.
→ DOCTOR dry-run: free and static. Clear means NO fail AND NO warn (`ok` alone proves nothing);
  resolve each warn or record why it is accepted before spending on provision.
→ PROVISION loop [CHECKPOINT: one OK covers the whole fix-and-rerun loop]: read the
  provisionTranscript, fix the script, re-run to ok. Confirm separately that destroy really
  tears down (destroy:none means hand-cleanup, recorded, human-accepted).
→ optional WORKSPACE-TEST [CHECKPOINT, only if asked]: create via the picker, verify
  sleep/wake/delete.
→ VERDICT: OFFLOADED, or OFFLOADED-WITH-PARKED with the checkpoint register.
```

## Convergence proof (definition of done)

Each recipe carries: a doctor result with zero fail and zero warn; a provision transcript with
ok:true across create→validate→destroy; state holding the AUTHENTICATED snapshotId plus the
authSourceSnapshotId it superseded; destroy enacted, not assumed. The verifier re-runs the
FREE doctor dry-run and re-derives the transcript's resource ids through provider read-only
verbs — it never re-provisions (a re-provision is a paid step, and paid steps are the human's).

## Ledger + supervision

Header at T0 per ledger-contract.md: `RUN · COORDINATOR · BASE · FORK_POINT · T0 · SOURCE ·
WIP` (SOURCE = provider + recipe id; WIP = 1 — snapshots are serial and paid). Header per liveness-resume.md: `RUN · COORDINATOR · BASE · FORK_POINT · T0 · SOURCE · WIP`. One row per
recipe: `| task_id | recipe | INTERVIEW | SCAFFOLD | BASE_SNAP | AUTH_SNAP | WIRED | DOCTOR |
PROVISION | destroy_tested | lighting | park | evidence |`. Paid checkpoints and the interactive
login are OPS-queue items with verify-complete observations; stalls → liveness-resume.md WATCH.

## Anti-patterns

Picking a provider, region, plan, or scope for the human (asked, never invented). Plain agent
login on a headless box (device-auth or hang). Grep-for-logged-in (matches "not logged in").
Snapshotting post-runtime state (every workspace from that image shares one pairing identity).
Secrets in scripts, userData, state, comments, docs, or commits. `provisioned-root` without an
explicit ask (and then only direct SSH + schema 2). Treating `ok:true` with warns as clear.
Bind-mounting a host agent home into the runtime (sqlite state and host config break there).
