  Resolve a foggy, multi-session goal into a frozen execution map that ship-it can consume — decisions,
  not deliverables. Chart a fog-of-war map of decision-tickets (only ticket what you can phrase sharply
  now), clear the research/decision frontier in parallel with HITL at each decision, and produce a
  frozen plan + a prepared DAG. Use when the goal is too big/foggy for one session, "chart this",
  "plan this epic", "I don't know the shape yet", or you can't yet authorize implementation. Its
  outcome is a decided plan; building is ship-it. Not for a foggy BUG (root-cause) or ready-to-build
  intent (ship-it).

# map-it — foggy goal → a frozen, decided execution map

You are the **COORDINATOR**. The terminal ARTIFACT is distinct from building: resolved decision tickets
plus a frozen execution map. Valuable precisely when the user does not want, or cannot yet authorize,
implementation. Inside ship-it, ordinary planning is a phase; map-it is invoked only when uncertainty
exceeds a declared threshold. Composes `decide-and-freeze`, `decompose-dag` (prepare only); rides
`gate-classification`, `liveness-resume`, `evidence-manifest`. Worker TASK pack: matt — never co-mount.

## Two terminal outcomes

- **MAPPED** — destination named; every open question is a sharp ticket (resolved) or explicit
  "not yet specified"; human-resolved decisions; frozen plan/spec + prepared, verified, frozen-for-
  handoff DAG that ship-it can consume without re-grilling.
- **MAPPED-WITH-BLOCKED** (degraded) — map is frozen for what is known, but ≥1 decision ticket is
  blocked on a human who has not answered; handoff lists blockers. Never reported as MAPPED.

## Pipeline (plan, don't do)

```
NAME the destination first (fixes scope — everything past it is out of scope; everything before but
  not-yet-sharp is FOG) → chart the MAP as decision-tickets
  → FOG-OF-WAR rule: only ticket what you can phrase SHARPLY now (the test is "can you state the
    question, not answer it"). Not-yet-sharp → "not yet specified".
  → clear the FRONTIER in parallel: Research tickets (AFK) gather evidence; Decision/Grill tickets are
    HITL (the agent never stands in for the human's side); one decision per session; resolving a ticket
    clears fog and graduates newly-sharp questions into fresh tickets
  → when the route is clear: FREEZE the plan/spec (decide-and-freeze) + PREPARE the DAG (decompose-dag,
    materialize but do not dispatch)
  → HANDOFF ARTIFACT CHECKLIST (ship-it adopts these without re-decomposing):
    · freeze commit SHA + path to frozen plan/spec
    · prepared DAG artifact path + task-id ↔ slice table
    · open "not yet specified" / blocked ticket list
    · evidence manifest naming MAPPED or MAPPED-WITH-BLOCKED
```

## Convergence proof

The destination is named; every open question is either a sharp ticket (resolved or blocked) or an
explicit "not yet specified"; every decision ticket was resolved by the HUMAN (not the agent) or is
explicitly blocked; a frozen plan/spec exists; a materialized, verified, FROZEN-for-handoff DAG exists
(decompose-dag's prepare-only completion — committed by freeze, not dispatch) that ship-it can consume
without re-grilling. The mission produces DECISIONS, not deliverables — no production code is written.
Handoff checklist complete.

## Ledger + supervision

Header per liveness-resume.md: `RUN · COORDINATOR · BASE=- · FORK_POINT=- · T0 · SOURCE` (SOURCE =
destination + freeze SHA when frozen). Rows include Orca task id + decision ticket fields. Multi-session
by design: stalls → WATCH; death → RESUME scoped to header coordinator + ledger task ids — never
re-grill resolved tickets.

## Anti-patterns

The agent answering its own decision/grill tickets (HITL leak). Charting fog you can't phrase now.
Resolving more than one decision per session. Sliding into building (that's ship-it — hand off at freeze).
Re-decomposing a prepared DAG in ship-it (orphans task ids).
